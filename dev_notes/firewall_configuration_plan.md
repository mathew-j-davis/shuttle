# Firewall Configuration Plan for REMOTE VM

## Current Situation
- **VM Being Configured**: REMOTE
- **Your Workstation**: LOCAL_DEV
- **Special Host**: ISOLATED (needs restricted access)
- **Network**: NETWORK (general network access)

## Requirements Summary
1. âœ… Allow Samba access to share '/in' from ISOLATED
2. âœ… Allow Samba access to share '/in' from LOCAL_DEV
3. ðŸš« Block Samba access from all other locations
4. ðŸš« Block ALL other services from ISOLATED (only Samba allowed)
5. ðŸ”“ Leave all other access from NETWORK and LOCAL_DEV unchanged

## CRITICAL: Pre-Configuration Safety Steps

### Step 1: Get IP Addresses
First, we need the IP addresses. Run these on each machine:
```bash
# On LOCAL_DEV:
ip addr show | grep inet

# On ISOLATED:
ip addr show | grep inet

# Get NETWORK subnet info if needed
```

### Step 2: Backup Current Firewall Rules
```bash
# On REMOTE VM - ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST!
sudo ufw status numbered > ~/firewall_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
sudo iptables-save > ~/iptables_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
```

### Step 3: Test Current Access
Before making changes, verify current access:
```bash
# From LOCAL_DEV - test SSH (so you don't lock yourself out!)
ssh user@REMOTE

# Test current Samba access if configured
smbclient -L //REMOTE -U username
```

## Safe Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Firewall Status
```bash
# On REMOTE VM
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh show-status
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh list-firewall-rules
```

### Step 2: Configure Host Isolation for ISOLATED (CAREFULLY!)
This is the most dangerous step - we're isolating ISOLATED to ONLY Samba:

```bash
# First, do a DRY RUN to see what will happen
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh isolate-host \
  --host <ISOLATED_IP> \
  --allowed-services samba \
  --comment "Isolated host - Samba only access" \
  --dry-run

# Review the output carefully!
# If it looks correct, run without --dry-run
```

### Step 3: Allow Samba from Specific Hosts
```bash
# Allow from LOCAL_DEV (your workstation)
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh allow-samba-from \
  --source <LOCAL_DEV_IP> \
  --comment "Samba access from LOCAL_DEV workstation" \
  --dry-run

# Allow from ISOLATED
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh allow-samba-from \
  --source <ISOLATED_IP> \
  --comment "Samba access from ISOLATED host" \
  --dry-run
```

### Step 4: Deny Samba from All Others
```bash
# Block Samba from everywhere else
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh deny-service-from \
  --service samba \
  --sources "0.0.0.0/0" \
  --comment "Block Samba from all other sources" \
  --dry-run
```

## IMPORTANT: Order Matters!

Firewall rules are processed in order. The correct sequence is:
1. **ALLOW** specific hosts (LOCAL_DEV, ISOLATED) for Samba
2. **DENY** Samba from all others (0.0.0.0/0)
3. **ISOLATE** the ISOLATED host (this adds deny rules for other services)

## Verification Commands

After applying rules:
```bash
# Check the final ruleset
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh list-firewall-rules

# Check isolated hosts
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh list-isolated-hosts

# Check Samba-specific rules
./scripts/2_post_install_config_steps/14_configure_firewall.sh list-samba-rules
```

## Testing After Configuration

### From LOCAL_DEV:
```bash
# Test SSH still works (critical!)
ssh user@REMOTE

# Test Samba access
smbclient //REMOTE/in -U domain_user
```

### From ISOLATED:
```bash
# Test Samba works
smbclient //REMOTE/in -U domain_user

# Test SSH is blocked (should fail)
ssh user@REMOTE  # This should timeout/fail
```

### From another host:
```bash
# Test Samba is blocked
smbclient //REMOTE/in -U domain_user  # Should fail
```

## Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong and you're locked out:
1. If you have console access to REMOTE VM:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw disable
   # or
   sudo ufw --force reset
   ```

2. If you saved the iptables rules:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables-restore < ~/iptables_backup_[date].txt
   ```

## Alternative Approach Using YAML

Instead of command-by-command, you could create a complete firewall.yaml:

```yaml
firewall:
  enabled: true
  default_policy:
    incoming: deny
    outgoing: allow
  rules:
    # Allow SSH from your workstation (IMPORTANT - don't lock yourself out!)
    ssh_admin:
      service: ssh
      action: allow
      sources: ["LOCAL_DEV_IP"]
      comment: "SSH from admin workstation"
    
    # Samba access for specific hosts
    samba_access:
      service: samba
      action: allow
      sources: ["LOCAL_DEV_IP", "ISOLATED_IP"]
      comment: "Samba access from authorized hosts only"
  
  # Host isolation
  isolated_hosts:
    - host: "ISOLATED_IP"
      allowed_services: ["samba"]
      comment: "Isolated host - Samba access only"
```

## Critical Reminders

1. **ALWAYS test with --dry-run first**
2. **NEVER disable SSH from your workstation (LOCAL_DEV)**
3. **Have console access ready as backup**
4. **Document all IP addresses before starting**
5. **Test incrementally - don't apply all rules at once**

Would you like me to help you:
1. Create the exact commands with your actual IP addresses?
2. Create a test plan to verify each step?
3. Create a YAML configuration file instead?
