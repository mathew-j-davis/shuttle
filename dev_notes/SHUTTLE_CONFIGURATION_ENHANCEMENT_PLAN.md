### Current Gaps and Limitations

#### ‚ùå **Wizard Integration Gaps**
- **No Samba Configuration Section**: Wizard doesn't configure shares, access controls, or host restrictions
- **Limited Firewall Integration**: Basic firewall checking only, no rule configuration
- **No Network Topology Support**: Can't define isolated hosts vs. normal network access
- **Missing Service Integration**: Samba and firewall rules aren't coordinated

#### ‚ùå **Configuration Schema Limitations**
- **YAML Schema**: No structure for Samba shares, firewall rules, or host-based access
- **Network Definitions**: No way to define network segments or host categories
- **Service Coordination**: No linkage between Samba shares and firewall access

#### ‚ùå **Advanced Feature Gaps**
- **Host Isolation**: No capability to allow specific services while denying others per host
- **Rule Management**: Missing bulk rule operations, rule priorities, and conflict resolution
- **Service Discovery**: No automatic network scanning or service detection

## Enhancement Plan

      - 192.168.1.100 (production-server)
      - 192.168.1.101 (backup-server)
   
   üìç Normal Hosts (regular network access):
      - 192.168.1.0/24 (excluding isolated hosts)

3. Default Policies:
   ‚úÖ Isolated hosts: Allow Samba, Deny all others
   ‚úÖ Normal hosts: Deny Samba, Allow SSH/HTTP
```
